TRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TMS)
Use of the rail networks around the world is growing fast. Railways and metros often wish to run more trains on the existing infrastructure, to carry more passengers and freight - and generate increased revenues. Optimizing existing infrastructure avoids the huge investment required for new lines and new trains. One proven way to achieve greater frequency of service is to use cutting edge technology solutions to manage rail traffic – and to do it in a sustainable manner.

HBL’s-Train Management System (TMS) is an integrated real-time Traffic Management System that offers monitoring and control of train movements. TMS imports the status of signals, track circuits and points etc. from the station interlocking system on a real time basis. TMS also obtains the train/rake identification details from the originating point of the TMS zone/territory. This information is processed and used to monitor the movement of trains and facilitates timely decision making. TMS can regulate train movement, diversion of trains, induction of trains, withdrawal of trains and planning reversal of trains in the TMS zone/territory defined in the scheme.

The TMS remote route setting option enables controllers to set the routes for the regular traffic movement and also prioritize the handling of emergencies.
